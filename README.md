# Machine-Learning_homeworks

This repository contains the code developed to complete homeworks assigned in the course of [Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/diag.uniroma1.it/machine-learning/home2324)

## Homework 1

You can find a detailed report of the activity [here](https://github.com/STaliani/Machine-Learning_homeworks/blob/main/Homework_1/Saverio_Taliani_ML_hw1.pdf)

It is composed by a classification task and a regression task.

_Classification_:

Given a dataset describing starting, final position, velocity and orientation of five drones decide the number of collisions.

_Regression_:

With the same dataset find the "Closest point of approach" among the drones.

### Objective of the homework

Use of standard machine learning models such:
- SVM
- Decision tree

And some basics techniques like:
- Grid search
- Data augmentation
- Normalization

## Homework 2

You can find a detailed report of the activity [here](https://github.com/STaliani/Machine-Learning_homeworks/blob/main/Homework_2/Saverio_Taliani_ML_hw2.pdf)

The assigned task was to choose any images dataset composed by at least 10 classes and perform a classification using Convolutional Neural Networks.

### Objective of the homework

Use neural networks approach for classification
Understand the basic techniques:
- Drop out
- Batch normaliation
- Others ...
